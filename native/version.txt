1.0 - This port still uses the MooTools view components (e.g., data grid), 
	  but uses the PureMVC JavaScript Native port rather than the PureMVC
	  MooTools port. The difference is that the Native Port can work with
	  any framework for DOM abstraction, but is not tied to any of them.
	  In the same app, you could use one or more view components from ExtJS, 
	  jQuery, MooTools, etc., or nothing at all if you're so inclined. 
	  The faux-class construction syntax is library independent JS.
