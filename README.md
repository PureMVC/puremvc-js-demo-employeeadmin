## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) [JavaScript](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-js-multicore-framework/wiki) Demo - Employee Admin
This demo illustrates techniques for performing routine client-side maintenance operations in a PureMVC-based application using Sencha ExtJS view components. 

The pseudo-classes are written in ExtJS-style rather than PureMVC's optional built-in style, demonstrating how PureMVC can be used even when the class emulation is provided by another framework.
